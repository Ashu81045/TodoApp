1. It is assumed that the system is having node >=10 and npm >=6 installed.
2. Now make a folder in any directory, eg: User/Desktop/ReactApp
3. Now install npm install create-react-app -g for installing React or it is
   good if it is preinstall.
4. Now create a react demo app using create-react-app: User/Desktop/ReactApp>
   npx install create-react-app demo-app.
5. Now, cd demo-app and run "npm start" and checks it is opening react 
   application on port 3000.
6. Unzip the downloaded folder and copy the folder under the name todoApp to 
   the same folder where you have created reactApp. i.e; User/Desktop/ReactApp> ls -l
   demo-app and todoApp folder should be there.
7. Now copy the node_modules folder from demo-app to todoApp folder.
8. After copying, install below two dependencies in the todoApp directory:
	User/Desktop/ReactApp/todoApp> npm install react-router-dom
	User/Desktop/ReactApp/todoApp> npm install react-minimal-pie-chart
